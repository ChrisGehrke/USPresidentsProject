*This project demonstrates building a full stack web application.

When you get to the main page you can search presidents by term, party, view them all, first name, and last name. 

Each search will bring you to a carousel that scrolls through all of the presidents you searched for. You can click left or right to view the next or previous president in your search. You need to keep your mouse pointer on the screen in order for the carousel to stay on that page. Otherwise it will keep scrolling every four seconds.

In order to get back to the main screen all you have to do is hit the back button on the browser or just hit the backspace on the keyboard but on the chrome browser you can't do that so you would have to hit (command [ ). Also you can use the two finger left swipe on your touch pad.
